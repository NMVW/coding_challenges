// AMAZON RECRUITMENT PROCESS (September start - December end)

// 1. Recruiter reached out to me via LinkedIn DM
// 2. Naively flattered (come on it's Amazon!) we connected and scheduled a 10 min intro call
// 3. Intro call ended up being 30 min longer than expected and recruiter has little technical knowledge
// 4. Thrown off by my request to not do PageRank coding challenge (4 hrs of my time) instead of live interview (1hr of my and "valuable engineer" time)
// 5. Hand-off to automated email flow, pick a date with an engineer (Amazon proprietary scheduling)
// 6. Got stood up at technical interview, rescheduled
// 7. Second interview had Indian who had difficulty speaking english and explaining the problem statement
// 8. Took 20 minutes to explain the ambiguous problem statement, wrote a few lines of code, no whiteboarding, crappy Amazon Chime video conference + live coding link (CoderPad much better quality)

// Ghosted after the interview, with zero feedback, but got an email requesting my feedback on the interview process?

// Next steps were outlined in initial call with recruiter

// 9. Hiring Manager interview
// 10. Interview with 2 employees managed by HM
// 11. Interview with random "bar raiser" employee to gauge your "potential" at amazon
// 12. Goal to get 2 offers from 2 different teams



// BELOW live coding challenge described
